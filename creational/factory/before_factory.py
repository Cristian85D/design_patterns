"""
Consider a way to create an object representing some model of a car.

Here I support three car models, Chevy Volt, a Ford Fusion, and a Jeep Sahara.
There's a null car too.

ChevyVolt class looks like this. It implements a start and stop method,
both of which just print messages for testing.
The other two car classes look very much the same.

Problem with this approach:
Each time we add a car, we must add one instance of it in the if-else code
from getcar method
